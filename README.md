# Real-Estate-Investment-Advisor

## 📄 Project Overview

This project is designed to help analyze and advise on real-estate investment opportunities using data analysis techniques. It provides tools and insights to evaluate real estate investments — enabling users to make informed investment decisions based on data.

The core implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook: `labmentix_project_realestate.ipynb`.

## 🔧 What’s Inside

- `labmentix_project_realestate.ipynb` — The main notebook containing data analysis, visualizations, and investment-advisor logic.
- (Future) You may add datasets, scripts, or additional notebooks as needed.

---

## ✅ Functionality & Goals

With this project you can:

- Load and preprocess real-estate related data.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand property trends and features.  
- Evaluate properties/investments based on various quantitative criteria (price, ROI potential, location factors, etc.).  
- Optionally visualize results (charts, graphs) to aid decision making.  
- Use the notebook as a basis for building a more comprehensive real-estate investment advisory dashboard or tool.

## 📈 Extending This Project / Future Ideas

- Add real-estate datasets (CSV, JSON, etc.) to perform more detailed analyses.  
- Build a web-based dashboard using frameworks like Streamlit / Dash to make the tool more user-friendly.  
- Incorporate external data sources (e.g., neighbourhood demographics, historical price trends, interest rates).  
- Add models for predicting future property value or rental yield.  
- Add filtering and recommendation system (best investment opportunities based on user’s budget, risk tolerance, location preference).
